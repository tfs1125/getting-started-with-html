<h3>Technological Empathy &amp; Stoopid Computers</h3>
<p>Technological Empathy is having an understanding for how a specific or suite of related technologies <em>work &amp; function</em>.  It could be in the form of mechanical empathy that allows you to successfully rebuild a 1953 CHEVY (definitely not me); or, an empathy around the internet or computers (of which I possess slightly more, but not much) that allows you to understand and leverage your understanding to make a computer perform the tasks you wish.  Part of technological empathy around computers is understanding that they are stoopid.&nbsp;&nbsp;  However, I tend to think that they are more 'imaginationally challenged', then stupid.  So, a computer, unlike my youngest daughter, will do exactly what you tell it to do and in the proscribed time, manner, and method.  Sort of like my oldest daugther when she wants to push my buttons. For example, I am <b><em>really</em> liking this class and want to really emphasize 'really'.  However, if I end the italics, but forget to te</b>ll it to stop bolding the text (Oops!), it will keep on doing what I told it do or not do what I didn't tell it.</p>
<h3>The Internet</h3>
<p>To me, the internet comprises both the information/data that is  primarily contained, referenced, and linked through HTML docs and the channels through which we access the information, i.e. what connects our commputers, devices, household appliances, etc.  However, one day, I do hope to be able to better grasp the 'cloud'.<p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p><b>HTML:</b><br>Hypertext Markup Language is the backbone of the content on the web.  When you view a 'web' page through your browser, the browser is rendering the HTML in a manner that is visually accommodating to people, and hopefully, in an attractive and organized manner.  The hypertext is the content and the 'markup' tells the browser how to organize and display the information.<p>
<p><b>HTML Tags:</b><br>
&#60;tags&#62; comprise the basic grammar and syntax of HTML.  There are opening &#60;tags&#62; and closing &#60;/tags&#62; that will act to organize and display content in specific manners; and, everything between the opening and closing tag is called an <b>element</b>.  Most, but not all, &#60;tags&#62; will have a closing tag.  A few tags such as &#60;br&#62; or &#60;img&#62;do not have closing tags, and are called 'void' tags.<br>
<br>Another distinction between tags is whether or not they are considered to 'inline' or 'block' tags.  Inline and block tags organize the white space within a document in different ways.  A block tag imparts a dimensionality to the element that is interpreted as a box or block, whereas an inline, according to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elemente" style="text-decoration: none;">Mozilla Development Network</a>: "An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element." Examples of inline tag is the &#60;br&#62;<br> that wraps the text. And the &#60;span&#62; tag <span class="alt-text">that may be used to alternatively style a block of text.</span></p>
<p>An example of a block tag is the &#60;p&#62; or paragraph tag.</p>
<p><b>Attributes</b><br>
Elements can have attributes; and, attributes will have 'values' that can modify the element.  Some elements are required to have attributes like &#60;img&#62 and &#60;a&#62. So if I wanted to show the image of and provide a link to a tribute to the very first computer I ever used: <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/08/03/trs-80/" target="_blank" alt="TRS 80 Computer"><img class="trs-80" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/TRS-80_Model_III.jpg"></a>   The TRS80! (Image: Wiki Commons)<br><br>  Back when Radio Shack used to be cool...
